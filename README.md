# test-of-fate

## This is a simple quiz that moves on when you answer right and is supposed to add time when the answer is wrong.

-   The motivation that caused me to build this website was thinking about ways I would use this in the future or how I could simply build a quiz from scratch.

-   I built this project to demonstrate my ability to craft a homemade quiz

-   What I learned from this project is that there are "many ways to cut a kiwi" -Nate, in the sense that there are multiple ways to have a process
## Usage
-   The user is supposed to click on the start quiz button, within the given time answer the correct questions and proceed to the next question. 
    after the given time the quiz is supposed to display highscores and log them
